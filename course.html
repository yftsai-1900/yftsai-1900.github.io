        <h2>Course Projects</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt><a href="course-pdf/Knots_in_Electromagnetism.pdf">2025 - Electrodynamics(II): Knots in Electromagnetism</a></dt>
          <dd>
            <em>- Starting from Magnetohydrodynamics, we discuss the conservation of magnetic flux and helicity, identifying the relavant topological properties as linking numbers and self-linking numbers. We also describe the topological properties in terms of Hopfions for the situations with the presence of electric fields. -</em>
          </dd>
          <dt>2023 - Quantum Technology and Its Applications</dt>
          <dd>
            I chose to report Quantinuum's realization of non-abelian topological order on ion trapped quantum computer. The report includes the introduction of non-abelian anyons and the properties of their H2 computer.
          </dd>
          <dt><a href="course-pdf/Final_report_StatMech_2_107022139.pdf">2021 - Statistical Mechanics(II): Polymer Physics</a></dt>
          <dd>
            This final report review the critical phenomena of ideal chains studied in the book ”Scaling Concepts in Polymer Physics” published in 1979, written by the 1991 Nobel Prize Winner Pierre-Gilles de Gennes.
          </dd>
          <dt><a href="notes/note2.pdf">2021 - Computational physics: 1D Transverse Field Ising Model using Tensor Network</a></dt>
          <dd>
            Use cyntx package to write tensor network for 1D transverse field Ising model, and calculate the ground state energy and correlation functions.
          </dd>
          <dt>2021 - History of physics: Second-Order Phase Transition</dt>
          <dd>
            After reading the original papers of the fundamental developments of modern physics in early 20th century, we were asked to write a report for one earliest paper of a fundamental idea. The topic I chose was Landau's second-order phase transition.
          </dd>
          <dt><a href="notes/note1.pdf">2019 - Experiemental Physics: Quadrabot</a></dt>
          <dd>
            <em>- Based on the experience with motor control, I built a quadrabot with self-made structures (designed using Solidworks), Arduino and servo motors. The quadrabot can perform simple movements such as stand up and sit down. -</em>
          </dd>
          <dt><a href="notes/note1.pdf">2017 - High School Graduation Project: Eddy-Current Braking and Motor Control</a></dt>
          <dd>
            <em>- Using homemade driver, Arduino and brushless DC motor, I built a motor control system with PI control and eddy- current braking. This project showed my ability to code, build hardware and debug. In that period, I was fascinated by Boston Dynamics and Hugh Herr's biomechatronic research. -</em>
